    "#### For most of us, it becomes very important to compare the neighborhoods between the current city and new city before accepting a new job offer in a different city. In this business problem, we help customers find the comparison between Toronto and New York cities by generating a popularity score for each of the cities based on popularity of the neighborhoods in each of the cities. \n",
    "#### The popularity score can be defined by the proximity and number of venues in each of the neighborhoods. More venues in a neighborhood increases the popularity score, and in the same way, more restaurants in a neighborhood increases the score further. For instance, if the overall popularity score of New York city is higher than Toronto, then one would prefer to choose a new job offer in New York City than in Toronto. This popularity score can be combined with the salary offers in each city to decide which city to choose.\n",
